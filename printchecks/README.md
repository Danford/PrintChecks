## 🛠️ Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### State Management (Pinia Stores)

The application uses **Pinia** for centralized state management:

1. **`app.ts`** - Global application state
   - Bank accounts management
   - Vendors management
   - Application settings

2. **`check.ts`** - Check creation and printing
   - Check form state
   - Check printing logic
   - Check validation

3. **`customization.ts`** - Visual customization
   - Font selections
   - Color schemes
   - Logo management
   - Style presets

4. **`receipt.ts`** - Receipt functionality
   - Line item management
   - Tax and fee calculations
   - Receipt generation

5. **`history.ts`** - Payment history
   - Payment logging (immutable)
   - Search and filtering
   - History analytics

### Composables

Reusable composition functions for shared logic:

- **`useFormatting.ts`** - Currency, number, and date formatting utilities

### Component Organization

- **`components/`** - Shared, reusable components
  - Modals for data entry
  - Core check printing component
  - Specialized sub-components for customization and receipts

- **`views/`** - Page-level components tied to routes
  - Each view represents a major application feature
  - Connected to router for navigation

## 🔧 Development Tips

### Clearing History During Development

When testing the history/logging system, use the special dev command:

```bash
npm run dev:clear
```

This automatically clears localStorage on startup. See `scripts/README.md` for details.

### Working with Fonts

The project includes an `expanded_fonts.js` file at the root that provides additional font options. Fonts are loaded dynamically based on user selections in the customization panel.

### Local Storage Schema

Data is stored in browser localStorage with these keys:

- `checkList` - Immutable payment history
- `bankAccounts` - Bank account information
- `vendors` - Vendor contact information
- `customization` - Style presets and settings
- `receipts` - Receipt data and line items

### Print Optimization

Check and receipt printing uses `print-js` for consistent cross-browser output. Key considerations:

- Print CSS is scoped to `.printable` classes
- Page breaks are controlled via CSS
- MICR fonts require proper embedding
- Test in Chrome/Firefox for best results

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dev server won't start

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Issue: TypeScript errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run type checking to see all errors
npm run type-check

# Ensure your IDE is using the workspace TypeScript version
```

### Issue: Fonts not displaying

**Solution:**
- Ensure `expanded_fonts.js` exists in the root directory
- Check browser console for font loading errors
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue: Printing looks wrong

**Solution:**
- Enable "Background graphics" in browser print settings
- Set margins to minimum or "None"
- Use 100% scale (no fit-to-page)
- Test in Chrome or Firefox

### Issue: Data not persisting

**Solution:**
- Check that localStorage is enabled in your browser
- Ensure you're not in private/incognito mode
- Check browser console for quota exceeded errors
- Export your data as backup before clearing localStorage

## 📚 Additional Resources

### Debug Scripts

See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for information about development utility scripts.

### Type Definitions

All TypeScript types are defined in `src/types/`. Import from `src/types/index.ts` for centralized access.

### Routing

Routes are defined in `src/router/index.ts`. All routes use lazy loading for optimal performance.
